# hello-world
This repository will start the process of me learning how to be a Web Developer.  
I'm a beginning Web Developer Master's degree student with prior programming experience in Arduino and Matlab.  I look forward to this new format and to sharing my work.
My username comes from some recent hobbies.  I've taken on a small flock of ducks that I proudly ordered off of the internet after some intense research on how to be a duck keeper, and as well I've taken on a hive of bees, which within the same year already had to be split into two hives.  They build up quickly!
